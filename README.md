# BattleshipProject

DISCLAIMER: I do not own the rights to Battleship.
This is purely a project for educational purposes in learning and practicing programming.

I want to have some fun with this.
There will be AI that is decent, the game will have color.
Game will also have interactive console controls instead of entering something and pressing Enter.
