# BattleshipProject

DISCLAIMER: I do not own the rights to Battleship.
This is purely a project for educational purposes in learning and practicing programming.
Project for DevCodeCamp.

THE GAME HAS QUITE A BIT OF SCREEN FLICKERING SO PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is my implementation of the classic battleship game with single player vs NPC and player vs player.
Since the game board is quite large, I would recommend two player games with honor rule to stay within 10 x 10.
It's a bit messy and I kind of want to do something with the basic tools for now.

It is still a console game, but will use font and background colors to highlight certain things.
Instead of typing in things, the console will ready key strokes to let the player interactively
place and rotate the ships. For calling the targets, the player can press number and letter keys to
have the game highlight the spot, and then the player can confirm with space bar / enter key.

I guess since I have not done much on Github over the years, for now this will be my flagship repo to show that I can code.
I should have some more exciting projects in the repo soon.
